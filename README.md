# Asspirational Financial Planner
## Technology Description

The project aims to create a sophisticated yet user-friendly platform that leverages the power of AI and web scraping technologies to provide users with a comprehensive financial planning tool. The platform would integrate APIs from multiple sources, like Autotrader, Zillow, and Apartment Finder, for real-time data on car values and housing prices.

By copying and pasting links from these websites, users can select their desired house or car, and the platform extracts the required data from these links. Additionally, the platform would utilize an AI-powered chatbot, like ChatGPT from OpenAI, to offer personalized financial advice based on users' choices.

The system also includes automated testing mechanisms to ensure the validity of the extracted data and to quickly adapt if the source websites change their structures. The platform is designed to be interactive, guiding users through a step-by-step wizard or calculator to build a comprehensive financial report based on their choices.

## About Our Project

**Welcome to our innovative financial planning platform.** 

This project stemmed from a simple yet profound realization: the world needs better financial education. Many individuals have aspirations without fully understanding the financial realities tied to their lifestyle choices. Our aim is to bridge this gap.

Our platform serves as an educational tool that allows users to plan their future lifestyle - from housing and cars to retirement and family costs - and then assess the income required to sustain it. We use real-time data from trusted sources like Zillow, Autotrader, and Apartment Finder, combined with advanced AI technologies, to give you an accurate picture of your financial future.

This project is more than just a tool, though. It's an ongoing educational endeavor. Our team consists of bright students eager to gain professional experience. Working on this platform, they are not just learning cutting-edge technologies but also contributing to a project that could change how people approach financial planning.

We hope that this platform helps you better understand your financial needs and guide you towards a stable and secure future.
